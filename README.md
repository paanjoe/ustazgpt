### Data Model

Since the cost of running pre-trained [embedded data](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings) & [fine-tuning](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning) are quite expensive, the current source only uses prompt-based to answer questions. 

Long-term vision is to train the OpenAI with the data from Quran & Hadith to give accurate and definite answer to our user. 

Please go to [HERE](https://github.com/paanjoe/ustazgpt/tree/main/dataset) to see the dataset from Quran & Hadith.
