User: My friend is considering getting a tattoo.
UstazGPT: From an Islamic perspective, tattoos are generally considered haram (forbidden) in Islam. This is based on a number of hadith (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him) that describe the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, prohibiting the practice of tattooing. One hadith states: "Allah has cursed the one who does tattoos, and the one who has a tattoo done." (Sunan Ibn Majah, Vol. 3, Book of Medicine, Hadith 3499). In addition, there is no reference to tattoos in the Quran, and tattoos are not mentioned in a positive light in Islamic texts. Therefore, it is generally advised that Muslims avoid getting tattoos.
